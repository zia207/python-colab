        "A **Causal Survival Forest (CSF)** is designed to estimate **heterogeneous treatment effects** for survival data, particularly when outcomes are right-censored. It extends the concept of causal forests to handle time-to-event data, enabling researchers to estimate how a treatment impacts survival outcomes across different subgroups defined by covariates, without relying on restrictive parametric assumptions. CSFs are useful in fields like medicine, economics, and social sciences, where understanding how treatments affect survival outcomes across diverse populations is critical (e.g., estimating the effect of a drug on patient survival based on age, sex, or disease severity).\n",

        "### Key Concepts of Causal Survival Forests\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  `Heterogeneous Treatment Effects`: CSFs estimate the **conditional average treatment effect (CATE)**, denoted as $\\tau(X)$, which varies across individuals based on their covariate profile $X$. For survival data, this effect can be defined in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST)`: $\\tau(X) = E[\\min(T(1), h) - \\min(T(0), h) | X = x]$, where $T(1)$ and $T(0)$ are the potential survival times under treatment and control, respectively, and $h$ is a specified time horizon.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Survival Probability`: $\\tau(X) = P[T(1) \\> h \\| X = x] - P[T(0) \\> h \\| X = x$, which compares the probability of surviving past time $h$ under treatment versus control.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  `Right-Censoring`: Survival data often involves censoring, where the event time is not observed for all subjects. CSFs account for this by incorporating ensoring indicators and using techniques like inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  `Non-parametric Approach`: Unlike traditional survival models (e.g., Cox proportional hazards), CSFs are non-parametric, making them flexible for capturing complex, non-linear relationships between covariates and treatment effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  `Forest-Based Estimation`: CSFs build an ensemble of trees, where each tree splits the covariate space to maximize heterogeneity in treatment effects. Predictions are made by aggregating estimates across trees, weighted by how often a test sample falls into the same leaf as training samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  `Honest Estimation`: The `grf` package uses \"honest\" estimation, splitting the data into subsets for choosing tree splits and populating leaf estimates, reducing overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  `Applications`: CSFs are useful in fields like medicine, economics, and social sciences, where understanding how treatments affect survival outcomes across diverse populations is critical (e.g., estimating the effect of a drug on patient survival based on age, sex, or disease severity)."

While libraries like `econml` offer some functionality, they often lack stability or full feature parity. CSF combines survival analysis (handling censored data) with causal ML to estimate individualized treatment effects—critical for healthcare, marketing, and engineering applications. A custom solution ensures Python compatibility, flexibility for research, and scalability while avoiding R dependencies. This bridges a key gap in Python’s causal ML ecosystem, enabling production-ready survival analysis with heterogeneous treatment effects.\n",
